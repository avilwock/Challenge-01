# Horiseon

## Description

This project focuses on a webpage for Horiseon, with the expectations of making provided code more user friendly. To accomplish this task, the HTML code was restructured to give it an easier to navigate format.

During this project I learned how to better group coding in HTML and CSS to make the code easier to read for others by condensing code into more manageable pieces.

A viewport was added in order to give the browser instructions regarding dimensions and scaling of the webpage.

Div elements were renamed with more fitting element names to provide better overall explanation of the different parts of the coding. An aside element was added to contain the information in a sidebar of the document. A figure element was also added to contain the background element because it was not content that affected, or was affected by, the rest of the code.

An addition of a unique identifier to coding for redirecting a broken link to the correct portion of document when clicked was added for the header "search-engine-optimization"
Search Engione, optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Medial Marketing were grouped together into a single class in order to make the CSS more accessible and condensed.

The CSS for the file was cleaned up as well, and comments were provided within the CSS code to define what different sections of the styling affected.

Portions of code with the same attributes were grouped together under the same class heading to condense the code.

Information for the benefit class element in the aside was moved below information related to the main document to better align with the order of the content on the HTML document.
