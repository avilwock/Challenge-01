# Challenge-01
# <Horiseon>

## Description

The expectations for this project were to take code for Horiseon's website, and make it more user friendly in regards to the code provided. To accomplish this task, the HTML code was restructured to give it an easier to navigate format. The CSS for the file was cleaned up as well, and comments were provided to define what different sections of the styling affected.

During this project I learned how to better group coding in HTML and CSS to make the code easier to read for others by condensing code into more manageable pieces.
